<p><i>The scene is a room in a small Sussex manor house
that has long been for sale. It is such a silent room
that whoever speaks first here is a bold one, unless
indeed he merely mutters to himself, which they
perhaps allow. All of this room’s past which can be
taken away has gone. Such light as there is comes
from the only window, which is at the back and is
incompletely shrouded in sacking. For a moment
this is a mellow light, and if a photograph could be
taken quickly we might find a disturbing smile on
the room’s face, perhaps like the Mona Lisa’s,
which came, surely, of her knowing what only the
dead should know. There are two doors, one leading
downstairs; the other is at the back, very insignificant,
though it is the centre of this disturbing history. The
wall-paper, heavy in the adherence of other papers of a
still older date, has peeled and leans forward here and
there in a grotesque bow, as men have hung in chains;
one might predict that the next sound heard here will
be in the distant future when another piece of paper
loosens. Save for two packing-cases, the only furniture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
is a worn easy-chair doddering by the unlit fire,
like some foolish old man. We might play with the
disquieting fancy that this room, once warm with
love, is still alive but is shrinking from observation,
and that with our departure they cunningly set to
again at the apparently never-ending search which
goes on in some empty old houses.</i></p>

<p><i>Some one is heard clumping up the stair, and the
caretaker enters. It is not she, however, who clumps;
she has been here for several years, and has become
sufficiently a part of the house to move noiselessly in
it. The first thing we know about her is that she does
not like to be in this room. She is an elderly woman of
gaunt frame and with a singular control over herself.
There may be some one, somewhere, who can make
her laugh still, one never knows, but the effort would
hurt her face. Even the war, lately ended, meant very
little to her. She has shown a number of possible
purchasers over the house, just as she is showing one
over it now, with the true caretaker’s indifference whether
you buy or not. The few duties imposed on her here
she performs conscientiously, but her greatest capacity
is for sitting still in the dark. Her work over, her
mind a blank, she sits thus rather than pay for a
candle. One knows a little more about life when he
knows the Mrs. Oterys, but she herself is unaware<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
that she is peculiar, and probably thinks that in some
such way do people in general pass the hour before
bedtime. Nevertheless, though saving of her candle
in other empty houses, she always lights it on the
approach of evening in this one.</i></p>

<p><i>The man who has clumped up the stairs in her
wake is a young Australian soldier, a private, such
as in those days you met by the dozen in any London
street, slouching along it forlornly if alone, with sudden
stoppages to pass the time (in which you ran against
him), or in affable converse with a young lady. In
his voice is the Australian tang that became such a
friendly sound to us. He is a rough fellow, sinewy,
with the clear eye of the man with the axe whose
chief life-struggle till the war came was to fell trees
and see to it that they did not crash down on him.
Mrs. Otery is showing him the house, which he has
evidently known in other days, but though interested
he is unsentimental and looks about him with a
tolerant grin.</i></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY.</span> This was the drawing-room.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> Not it, no, no, never. This wasn’t
the drawing-room, my cabbage; at least not in
my time.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY</span> (<i>indifferently</i>). I only came here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
about three years ago and I never saw the house
furnished, but I was told to say this was the
drawing-room. (<i>With a flicker of spirit.</i>) And
I would thank you not to call me your cabbage.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY</span> (<i>whom this kind of retort helps to put at
his ease</i>). No offence. It’s a French expression,
and many a happy moment have I given
to the mademoiselles by calling them cabbages.
But the drawing-room! I was a little shaver
when I was here last, but I mind we called the
drawing-room the Big Room; it wasn’t a little
box like this.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY.</span> This is the biggest room in the
house. (<i>She quotes drearily from some advertisement
which is probably hanging in rags on the
gate.</i>) Specially charming is the drawing-room
with its superb view of the Downs. This room
is upstairs and is approached by——</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> By a stair, containing some romantic
rat-holes. Snakes, whether it’s the room or
not, it strikes cold; there is something shiversome
about it.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>For the first time she gives him a sharp
glance.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>I’ve shivered in many a shanty in Australy,
and thought of the big room at home and the
warmth of it. The warmth! And now this is
the best it can do for the prodigal when he
returns to it expecting to see that calf done to a
turn. We live and learn, missis.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY.</span> We live, at any rate.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> Well said, my cabbage.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY.</span> Thank you, my rhododendron.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY</span> (<i>cheered</i>). I like your spirit. You
and me would get on great if I had time to devote
to your amusement. But, see here, I can
make sure whether this was the drawing-room.
If it was, there is an apple-tree outside there,
with one of its branches scraping on the window.
I ought to know, for it was out at the window
down that apple-tree to the ground that I slided
one dark night when I was a twelve-year-old, ran
away from home, the naughty blue-eyed angel
that I was, and set off to make my fortune on the
blasted ocean. The fortune, my—my lady friend—has
still got the start of me, but the apple-tree
should be there to welcome her darling boy.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>He pulls down the sacking, which lets a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
little more light into the room. We see
that the window, which reaches to the floor,
opens outwards. There were probably long
ago steps from it down into the garden, but
they are gone now, and gone too is the
apple-tree.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>I’ve won! No tree: no drawing-room.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY.</span> I have heard tell there was once
a tree there; and you can see the root if you
look down.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> Yes, yes, I see it in the long grass,
and a bit of the seat that used to be round it.
This is the drawing-room right enough, Harry,
my boy. There were blue curtains to that
window, and I used to hide behind them and
pounce out upon Robinson Crusoe. There was
a sofa at this end, and I had my first lessons in
swimming on it. You are a fortunate woman,
my petite, to be here drinking in these moving
memories. There used to be a peacock, too.
Now, what the hell could a peacock be doing in
this noble apartment?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY.</span> I have been told a cloth used to
hang on the wall here, tapestries they’re called,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
and that it had pictures of peacocks on it. I
dare say that was your peacock.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> Gone, even my peacock! And I
could have sworn I used to pull the feathers out
of its tail. The clock was in this corner, and it
had a wheezy little figure of a smith that used
to come out and strike the hour on an anvil.
My old man used to wind that clock up every
night, and I mind his rage when he found out it
was an eight-day clock. The padre had to reprove
him for swearing. Padre? What’s the
English for padre? Damme, I’m forgetting
my own language. Oh yes, parson. Is <i>he</i> in
the land of the living still? I can see him
clear, a long thin man with a hard sharp face.
He was always quarrelling about pictures he
collected.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY.</span> The parson here is a very old
man, but he is not tall and thin, he is little and
roundish with a soft face and white whiskers.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> Whiskers? I can’t think he had
whiskers. (<i>Ruminating.</i>) <i>Had</i> he whiskers?
Stop a bit, I believe it is his wife I’m thinking
about. I doubt I don’t give satisfaction as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
sentimental character. Is there any objection,
your ladyship, to smoking in the drawing-room?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY</span> (<i>ungraciously</i>). Smoke if you
want.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>He hacks into a cake of tobacco with a
large clasp knife.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>That’s a fearsome-looking knife.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> Useful in trench warfare. It’s not
a knife, it’s a visiting-card. You leave it on
favoured parties like this.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>He casts it at one of the packing-cases, and
it sticks quivering in the wood.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY.</span> Were you an officer?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> For a few minutes now and again.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY.</span> You’re playing with me.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> You’re so irresistible.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY.</span> Do you want to see the other
rooms?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> I was fondly hoping you would ask
me that.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY.</span> Come along then. (<i>She wants
to lead him downstairs, but the little door at the
back has caught his eye.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> What does that door open on?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY</span> (<i>avoiding looking at it</i>). Nothing,
it’s just a cupboard door.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY</span> (<i>considering her</i>). Who is playing
with me now?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY.</span> I don’t know what you mean.
Come this way.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY</span> (<i>not budging</i>). I’ll explain what I
mean. That door—it’s coming back to me—it
leads into a little dark passage.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY.</span> That’s all.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> That can’t be all. Who ever heard
of a passage wandering about by itself in a
respectable house! It leads—yes—to a single
room, and the door of the room faces this way.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>He opens the door, and a door beyond is
disclosed.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>There’s a memory for you! But what the hell
made you want to deceive me?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY.</span> It’s of no consequence.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> I think—yes—the room in there
has two stone windows—and wooden rafters.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY.</span> It’s the oldest part of the house.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> It comes back to me that I used to
sleep there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY.</span> That may be. If you’ll come
down with me——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> I’m curious to see that room first.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>(<i>She bars the way.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY</span> (<i>thin-lipped and determined</i>). You
can’t go in there.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> Your reasons?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY.</span> It’s—locked. I tell you it’s
just an empty room.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> There must be a key.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY.</span> It’s—lost.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> Queer your anxiety to stop me,
when you knew I would find the door locked.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY.</span> Sometimes it’s locked; sometimes
not.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> Is it not you that locks it?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY</span> (<i>reluctantly</i>). It’s never locked,
it’s held.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> Who holds it?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY</span> (<i>in a little outburst</i>). Quiet, man.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> You’re all shivering.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY.</span> I’m not.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY</span> (<i>cunningly</i>). I suppose you are just
shivering because the room is so chilly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY</span> (<i>falling into the trap</i>). That’s it.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> So you are shivering!</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>She makes no answer, and he reflects with
the help of his pipe.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>May I put a light to these bits of sticks?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY.</span> If you like. My orders are to
have fires once a week.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>He lights the twigs in the fireplace, and they
burn up easily, but will be ashes in a few
minutes.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p><i>You</i> can’t have the money to buy a house like
this.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> Not me. It was just my manly
curiosity to see the old home that brought me.
I’m for Australy again. (<i>Suddenly turning on
her.</i>) What is wrong with this house?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY</span> (<i>on her guard</i>). There is nothing
wrong with it.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> Then how is it going so cheap?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY.</span> It’s—in bad repair.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> Why has it stood empty so long?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY.</span> It’s—far from a town.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> What made the last tenant leave in
such a hurry?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY</span> (<i>wetting her lips</i>). You have heard
that, have you? Gossiping in the village, I
suppose?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> I have heard some other things as
well. I have heard they had to get a caretaker
from a distance, because no woman hereabout
would live alone in this house.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY.</span> A pack o’ cowards.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> I have heard that that caretaker was
bold and buxom when she came, and that now
she is a scared woman.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY.</span> I’m not.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> I have heard she’s been known to
run out into the fields and stay there trembling
half the night.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>She does not answer, and he resorts to
cunning again.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>Of course, I see they couldn’t have meant you.
Just foolish stories that gather about an old
house.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY</span> (<i>relieved</i>). That’s all.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY</span> (<i>quickly as he looks at the little door</i>).
What’s that?</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>(<span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY</span> <i>screams</i>.)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>I got you that time! What was it you expected
to see?</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>(<i>No answer.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>Is it a ghost? They say it’s a ghost. What is
it gives this house an ill name?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY.</span> Use as brave words as you like
when you have gone, but I advise you, my lad,
to keep a civil tongue while you are here. (<i>In
her everyday voice.</i>) There is no use showing
you the rest of the house. If you want to be
stepping, I have my work to do.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> We have got on so nicely I wonder if
you would give me a mug of tea. Not a cup,
we drink it by the mugful where I hail from.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY</span> (<i>ungraciously</i>). I have no objection.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY.</span> Come down then to the kitchen.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> No, no, I’m sure the Prodigal got
his tea in the drawing-room, though what made
them make such a fuss about that man beats me.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY</span> (<i>sullenly</i>). You are meaning to
go into that room. I wouldn’t if I was you.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> If you were me you would.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY</span> (<i>closing the little door</i>). Until I
have your promise——</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY</span> (<i>liking the tenacity of her</i>). Very well,
I promise—unless, of course, she comes peeping
out at the handsome gentleman. Your ghost
has naught to do wi’ me. It’s a woman, isn’t it?</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>(<i>Her silence is perhaps an assent.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>See here, I’ll sit in this chair till you come back,
saying my prayers. (<i>Feeling the chair.</i>) You’re
clammy cold, old dear. It’s not the ghost’s
chair by any chance, is it?</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>(<i>No answer.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>You needn’t look so scared, woman; she doesn’t
walk till midnight, does she?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY</span> (<i>looking at his knife in the wood</i>).
I wouldn’t leave that knife lying about.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> Oh, come, give the old girl a chance.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY.</span> I’ll not be more than ten
minutes.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> She can’t do much in ten minutes.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>At which remark</i> <span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY</span> <i>fixes him
with her eyes and departs</i>.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY</span> <i>is now sitting sunk in the chair,
staring at the fire. It goes out, but he remains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
there motionless, and in the increasing
dusk he ceases to be an intruder. He is
now part of the room, the part long waited
for, come back at last. The house is shaken
to its foundation by his presence, we may
conceive a thousand whispers. Then the
crafty work begins. The little door at the
back opens slowly to the extent of a foot.
Thus might a breath of wind blow it if there
were any wind. Presently</i> <span class="allsmcap">HARRY</span> <i>starts to
his feet, convinced that there is some one in
the room, very near his knife. He is so
sure of the exact spot where she is that for
a moment he looks nowhere else.</i></p>

<p><i>In that moment the door slowly closes. He
has not seen it close, but he opens it and
calls out, ‘Who is that? Is any one there?’
With some distaste he enters the passage and
tries the inner door, but whether it be locked
or held it will not open. He is about to
pocket his knife, then with a shrug of bravado
sends it quivering back into the wood—for
her if she can get it. He returns to the chair,
but not to close his eyes; to watch and to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
watched. The room is in a tremble of desire
to get started upon that nightly travail
which can never be completed till this man
is here to provide the end.</i></p>

<p><i>The figure of</i> <span class="allsmcap">HARRY</span> <i>becomes indistinct and
fades from sight. When the haze lifts we
are looking at the room as it was some thirty
years earlier on the serene afternoon that
began its troubled story. There are rooms
that are always smiling, so that you may
see them at it if you peep through the keyhole,
and</i> <span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND’S</span> <i>little drawing-room
is one of them. Perhaps these are
smiles that she has left lying about. She
leaves many things lying about; for instance,
one could deduce the shape of her
from studying that corner of the sofa which
is her favourite seat, and all her garments
grow so like her that her wardrobes are full
of herself hanging on nails or folded away
in drawers. The pictures on her walls in
time take on a resemblance to her or hers
though they may be meant to represent a
waterfall, every present given to her assumes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
some characteristic of the donor, and no
doubt the necktie she is at present knitting
will soon be able to pass as the person for
whom it is being knit. It is only delightful
ladies at the most agreeable age who have
this personal way with their belongings.
Among</i> <span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND’S</span> <i>friends in the
room are several of whom we have already
heard, such as the blue curtains from which</i>
<span class="allsmcap">HARRY</span> <i>pounced upon the castaway, the sofa
on which he had his first swimming lessons,
the peacock on the wall, the clock with the
smart smith ready to step out and strike his
anvil, and the apple-tree is in full blossom
at the open window, one of its branches has
even stepped into the room.</i></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND</span> <i>and the local clergyman are
chatting importantly about some matter of
no importance, while</i> <span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND</span> <i>is on
her sofa at the other side of the room, coming
into the conversation occasionally with a
cough or a click of her needles, which is her
clandestine way of telling her husband not to
be so assertive to his guest. They are all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
middle-aged people who have found life to
be on the whole an easy and happy adventure,
and have done their tranquil best to
make it so for their neighbours. The
squire is lean, the clergyman of full habit,
but could you enter into them you would
have difficulty in deciding which was clergyman
and which was squire; both can
be peppery, the same pepper. They are
benignant creatures, but could exchange
benignancies without altering.</i> <span class="allsmcap">MRS.
MORLAND</span> <i>knows everything about her
husband except that she does nearly all his
work for him. She really does not know
this. His work, though he rises early to
be at it, is not much larger than a lady’s
handkerchief, and consists of magisterial
duties, with now and then an impressive
scene about a tenant’s cowshed. She then
makes up his mind for him, and is still unaware
that she is doing it. He has so often
heard her say (believing it, too) that he is
difficult to move when once he puts his foot
down that he accepts himself modestly as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
man of this character, and never tries to
remember when it was that he last put down
his foot. In the odd talks which the happily
married sometimes hold about the future he
always hopes he will be taken first, being
the managing one, and she says little beyond
pressing his hand, but privately she has
decided that there must be another arrangement.
Probably life at the vicarage is on
not dissimilar lines, but we cannot tell as
we never meet</i> <span class="allsmcap">MR. AMY’S</span> <i>wife</i>. <span class="allsmcap">MR. AMY</span>
<i>is even more sociable than</i> <span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND</span>;
<i>he is reputed to know every one in the
county, and has several times fallen off his
horse because he will salute all passers-by.
On his visits to London he usually returns
depressed because there are so many people
in the streets to whom he may not give a
friendly bow. He likes to read a book if
he knows the residence or a relative of the
author, and at the play it is far more to him
to learn that the actress has three children,
one of them down with measles, than to follow
her histrionic genius. He and his host<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
have the pleasant habit of print-collecting,
and a very common scene between them is
that which now follows. They are bent
over the squire’s latest purchase.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. AMY.</span> Very interesting. A nice little lot.
I must say, James, you have the collector’s flair.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> Oh, well, I’m keen, you
know, and when I run up to London I can’t
resist going a bust in my small way. I picked
these up quite cheap.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. AMY.</span> The flair. That is what you have.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> Oh, I don’t know.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. AMY.</span> Yes, you have, James. You got
them at Peterkin’s in Dean Street, didn’t you?
Yes, I know you did. I saw them there. I
wanted them too, but they told me you had
already got the refusal.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> Sorry to have been too quick
for you, George, but it is my way to nip in.
You have some nice prints yourself.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. AMY.</span> I haven’t got your flair, James.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> I admit I don’t miss much.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. AMY.</span> You didn’t examine the little lot
lying beneath this lot.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> I turned them over; just a
few odds and ends of no account.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. AMY</span> (<i>with horrible complacency</i>). All
except one, James.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND</span> (<i>twitching</i>). Something good?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. AMY</span> (<i>at his meekest</i>). Just a little trifle
of a Gainsborough.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND</span> (<i>faintly</i>). What! You’ve got
it?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. AMY.</span> I’ve got it. I am a poor man,
but I thought ten pounds wasn’t too much for
a Gainsborough.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>(<i>The devil now has them both.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> Ten pounds! Is it signed?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. AMY.</span> No, it isn’t signed.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND</span> (<i>almost his friend again</i>). Ah!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. AMY.</span> What do you precisely mean by
that ‘Ah,’ James? If it had been signed, could
I have got it for ten pounds? You are always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
speaking about your flair; I suppose I can have
a little flair sometimes too.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> I am not always speaking
about my flair, and I don’t believe it is a
Gainsborough.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. AMY</span> (<i>with dignity</i>). Please don’t get hot,
James. If I had thought you would grudge me

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> Weak and laboured. Look
at that horse.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. AMY.</span> Gainsborough did some very funny
horses.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> Granted, but he never placed
them badly. That horse destroys the whole
balance of the composition.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. AMY.</span> James, I had no idea you had
such a small nature.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> I don’t like that remark; for
your sake I don’t like it. No one would have
been more pleased than myself if you had picked
up a Gainsborough. But this! Besides, look at
the paper.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. AMY.</span> What is wrong with the paper,
Mr. Morland?</p>

Nonsense, James.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> He is quite different from
breakfast-time. He doesn’t laugh any more,
he would never think of capsizing the punt

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON</span> (<i>tacking</i>). Yes, rather; and so you

Mary Rose has noticed it too. That is my

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND.</span> Did Mary Rose tell you to

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON</span> (<i>guiltily</i>). Well— (<i>Tap, tap.</i>) Oh,

Mrs. Morland, for a mother-in-law.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND</span> (<i>a demon</i>). Did she tell you to

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> Well— At any rate, never shall I

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> She is not your wife yet, you

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON</span> (<i>handsomely</i>). No, she isn’t. But can
she be? Mrs. Morland, can she be?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND.</span> That is as may be, Simon.
It is only a possible engagement that we are
discussing at present.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> Yes, yes, of course. (<i>Becoming more

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND.</span> No!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> Yes; she is doing that to help me.
I promised to knock back as soon as I thought
things were going well. What do you say?

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND</span> (<i>braver</i>). No. (<i>Tremulously.</i>)
There is a little thing, Simon, that Mary Rose’s
father and I feel we ought to tell you about her
before—before you knock, my dear. It is not
very important, I think, but it is something she
doesn’t know of herself, and it makes her a little
different from other girls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span><span class="allsmcap">SIMON</span> (<i>alighting—sharply</i>). I won’t believe
anything against Mary Rose.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND.</span> We have nothing to tell you
against her.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> It is just something that
happened, Simon. She couldn’t help it. It
hasn’t troubled us in the least for years, but we
always agreed that she mustn’t be engaged
before we told the man. We must have your
promise, before we tell you, that you will keep
it to yourself.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON</span> (<i>frowning</i>). I promise.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND.</span> You must never speak of it
even to her.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> Not to Mary Rose? I wish you
would say quickly what it is.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>They are now sitting round the little table.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> It can’t be told quite in a
word. It happened seven years ago, when
Mary Rose was eleven. We were in a remote
part of Scotland—in the Outer Hebrides.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> I once went on shore there from the
<i>Gadfly</i>, very bleak and barren, rocks and
rough grass, I never saw a tree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> It is mostly like that. There
is a whaling-station. We went because I was
fond of fishing. I haven’t had the heart to fish
since. Quite close to the inn where we put up
there is—a little island.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>He sees that little island so clearly that he
forgets to go on.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND.</span> It is quite a small island,
Simon, uninhabited, no sheep even. I suppose
there are only about six acres of it. There are
trees there, quite a number of them, Scotch firs
and a few rowan-trees, they have red berries,
you know. There seemed to us to be nothing
very particular about the island, unless, perhaps,
that it is curiously complete in itself. There is
a tiny pool in it that might be called a lake, out
of which a stream flows. It has hillocks and a
glade, a sort of miniature land. That was all
we noticed, though it became the most dreaded
place in the world to us.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND</span> (<i>considerately</i>). I can tell him
without your being here, Fanny.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND.</span> I prefer to stay, James.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> I fished a great deal in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
loch between that island and the larger one.
The sea-trout were wonderful. I often rowed
Mary Rose across to the island and left her there
to sketch. She was fond of sketching in those
days, we thought them pretty things. I could
see her from the boat most of the time, and we
used to wave to each other. Then I would go
back for her when I stopped fishing.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND.</span> I didn’t often go with them.
We didn’t know at the time that the natives had
a superstition against landing on the island,
and that it was supposed to resent this. It had
a Gaelic name which means ‘The Island that
Likes to be Visited.’ Mary Rose knew nothing
of this, and she was very fond of her island.
She used to talk to it, call it her darling, things
like that.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON</span> (<i>restless</i>). Tell me what happened.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> It was on what was to be our
last day. I had landed her on this island as
usual, and in the early evening I pulled across
to take her off. From the boat I saw her,
sitting on a stump of a tree that was her favourite
seat, and she waved gaily to me and I to her.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
Then I rowed over, with, of course, my back to
her. I had less than a hundred yards to go, but,
Simon, when I got across she wasn’t there.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> You seem so serious about it. She
was hiding from you?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND.</span> She wasn’t on the island,
Simon.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> But—but—oh, but——</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> Don’t you think I searched
and searched?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND.</span> All of us. No one in the
village went to bed that night. It was then we
learned how they feared the island.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> The little pool was dragged.
There was nothing we didn’t try; but she was
gone.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON</span> (<i>distressed</i>). I can’t—there couldn’t—but
never mind that. Tell me how you found
her.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND.</span> It was the twentieth day
after she disappeared. Twenty days!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> Some boat——?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> There was no boat but mine.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> Tell me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND.</span> The search had long been
given up, but we couldn’t come away.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> I was wandering one day
along the shore of the loch, you can imagine in
what state of mind. I stopped and stood looking
across the water at the island, and, Simon,
I saw her sitting on the tree-trunk sketching.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND.</span> Mary Rose!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> She waved to me and went
on sketching. I—I waved back to her. I got
into the boat and rowed across just in the old
way, except that I sat facing her, so that I could
see her all the time. When I landed, the first
thing she said to me was, ‘Why did you row in
that funny way, Dad?’ Then I saw at once
that she didn’t know anything had happened.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> Mr. Morland! How could—? Where
did she say she had been?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND.</span> She didn’t know she had
been anywhere, Simon.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> She thought I had just come
for her at the usual time.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> Twenty days. You mean she had
been on the island all that time?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> We don’t know.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND.</span> James brought her back to
me just the same merry unselfconscious girl,
with no idea that she had been away from me
for more than an hour or two.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> But when you told her——</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND.</span> We never told her; she
doesn’t know now.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> Surely you——</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND.</span> We had her back again,
Simon; that was the great thing. At first
we thought to tell her after we got her
home; and then, it was all so inexplicable,
we were afraid to alarm her, to take the
bloom off her. In the end we decided never
to tell her.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> You told no one?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> Several doctors.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> How did they explain it?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> They had no explanation for
it except that it never took place. You can
think that, too, if you like.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> I don’t know what to think. It has
had no effect on her, at any rate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> None whatever—and you can
guess how we used to watch.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND.</span> Simon, I am very anxious
to be honest with you. I have sometimes
thought that our girl is curiously young for her
age—as if—you know how just a touch of frost
may stop the growth of a plant and yet leave it
blooming—it has sometimes seemed to me as if
a cold finger had once touched my Mary Rose.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> Mrs. Morland!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND.</span> There is nothing in it.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> What you are worrying about is just
her innocence—which seems a holy thing to me.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND.</span> And indeed it is.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> If that is all——</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> We have sometimes thought
that she had momentary glimpses back into that
time, but before we could question her in a
cautious way about them the gates had closed and
she remembered nothing. You never saw her
talking to—to some person who wasn’t there?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND.</span> Nor listening, as it were, for
some sound that never came?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> A sound? Do you mean a sound
from the island?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND.</span> Yes, we think so. But
at any rate she has long outgrown those
fancies.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>She fetches a sketch-book from a drawer.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>Here are the sketches she made. You can take
the book away with you and look at them at
your leisure.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> It is a little curious that she has never
spoken to me of that holiday. She tells me
everything.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND.</span> No, that isn’t curious, it is
just that the island has faded from her
memory. I should be troubled if she began
to recall it. Well, Simon, we felt we had to
tell you. That is all we know, I am sure it
is all we shall ever know. What are you going
to do?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> What do you think!</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>He mounts the chair again, and knocks

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND</span> (<i>kissing him</i>). You dear boy,

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> I do love Mary Rose, sir.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> So do we, Simon. I suppose
that made us love her a little more than other
daughters are loved. Well, it is dead and done
with, and it doesn’t disturb me now at all.
I hope you won’t let it disturb you.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON</span> (<i>undisturbed</i>). Rather not. (<i>Disturbed.</i>)
I say, I wonder whether I <i>have</i> noticed
her listening for a sound?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> Not you. We did wisely,
didn’t we, in not questioning her?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> Oh, lord, yes. ‘The Island that
Likes to be Visited.’ It is a queer name.
(<i>Boyishly.</i>) I say, let’s forget all about it. (<i>He

it is father, it is poor father. Oh, Simon, how

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> I should just say it is. Is
your mother crying too?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE</span> (<i>squeaking</i>). Yes.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> I see I am going to have an
abominable day. If you two don’t mind very
much being left alone, I think I’ll go up and sit in
the apple-room and cry with your mother. It is
close and dark and musty up there, and when we
feel we can’t stick it any longer I’ll knock on the
floor, Simon, as a sign that we are coming down.</p>

see, I have a ton of things to tell you. About
how I put it to them, and how I remembered
what you told me to say, and the way I got the
soft side of them. They have heard it all already,
so it would really be selfish to bring them down.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> I’m not so sure.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> I’ll tell you what we’ll do. Let’s

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> All right. Tell me, what were you

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> Rather. Honest Injun, we’ll be

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> A little.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> Only a little?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> But frightfully clearly. (<i>Suddenly.</i>)
Simon, I had such a delicious idea about
our honeymoon. There is a place in Scotland—in
the Hebrides—I should love to go there.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON</span> (<i>taken aback</i>). The Hebrides?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> We once went to it when I was
little. Isn’t it funny, I had almost forgotten
about that island, and then suddenly I saw it
quite clearly as I was sitting up there. (<i>Senselessly.</i>)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
Of course it was the little old woman who
pointed it out to me.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<span class="allsmcap">SIMON</span> <i>is disturbed.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON</span> (<i>gently</i>). Mary Rose, there are only
yourselves and the three maids in the house,
aren’t there?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE</span> (<i>surprised</i>). You know there are.
Whatever makes you ask?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON</span> (<i>cautiously</i>). I thought—I thought I
had a glimpse of a little old woman on the stair
to-day.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE</span> (<i>interested</i>). Who on earth could
that be?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> It doesn’t matter, I had made a
mistake. Tell me, what was there particular
about that place in the Hebrides?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Oh, the fishing for father. But
there was an island where I often— My little
island!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON</span> (<i>perhaps quite unnecessarily</i>). What are
you listening for, Mary Rose?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Was I? I don’t hear anything.
Oh, my dear, my dear, I should love
to show you the tree-trunk and the rowan-tree<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
where I used to sketch while father was in the
boat. I expect he used to land me on the
island because it was such a safe place.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON</span> (<i>troubled</i>). That had been the idea. I
am not going to spend my honeymoon by
the sea, though. And yet I should like to go
to the Hebrides—some day—to see that island.</p>

<p><i>An island in the Outer Hebrides. A hundred yards
away, across the loch at the back, may be seen the
greater island of which this might be but a stone cast
into the sea by some giant hand: perhaps an evil
stone which the big island had to spew forth but could
not sink. It is fair to look upon to-day, all its menace
hidden under mosses of various hues that are a
bath to the eye; an island placid as a cow grazing
or a sulky lady asleep. The sun which has left the
bleak hills beyond is playing hide and seek on it—one
suddenly has the curious fancy to ask, with whom?
A blessed spot it might be thought, rather than sinister,
were there not those two trees, a fir and a rowan, their
arms outstretched for ever southward, as if they had
been struck while in full flight and could no longer
pray to their gods to carry them away from this island.
A young Highlander, a Cameron, passes in a boat at
the back. Mary Rose and Simon come into view on
the island. We have already heard them swishing
a way through whins and bracken that are unseen.
They are dressed as English people dress in Scotland.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
They have been married for four years and are still
the gay young creatures of their engagement day.
Their talk is the happy nonsense that leaves no ripple
unless the unexpected happens.</i></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE</span> (<i>thrilled</i>). I think, I think, I
don’t think at all, I am quite sure. This is
the place. Simon, kiss me, kiss me quick. You
promised to kiss me quick when we found
the place.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON</span> (<i>obeying</i>). I am not the man to break
my word. At the same time, Mary Rose, I
would point out to you that this is the third
spot you have picked out as being the place,
and three times have I kissed you quick on that
understanding. This can’t go on, you know.
As for your wonderful island, it turns out to be
about the size of the Round Pond.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> I always said it was little like
myself.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> It was obviously made to fit you, or
you to fit it; one of you was measured for the
other. At any rate, we have now been all round
it, and all through it, as my bleeding limbs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
testify. (<i>The whins have been tearing at him, and
he rubs his legs.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> They didn’t hurt me at all.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> Perhaps they like you better than
me. Well, we have made a good search for the
place where you used to sit and sketch, and you
must now take your choice.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> It was here. I told you of the
fir and the rowan-tree.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> There were a fir and a rowan at each
of the other places.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Not this fir, not this rowan.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> You have me there.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Simon, I know I’m not clever,
but I’m always right. The rowan-berries! I used
to put them in my hair. (<i>She puts them in her hair
again.</i>) Darling rowan-tree, are you glad to see me
back? You don’t look a bit older, how do you
think I am wearing? I shall tell you a secret.
You too, firry. Come closer, both of you. Put
your arms around me, and listen: I am married!</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>The branch of which she has been making
a scarf disengages itself.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>It didn’t like that, Simon, it is jealous. After<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
all, it knew me first. Dearest trees, if I had
known that you felt for me in that way—but it
is too late now. I have been married for nearly
four years, and this is the man. His name is
Lieutenant Simon Sobersides. (<i>She darts about
making discoveries.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON</span> (<i>tranquilly smoking</i>). What is it
now?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> That moss! I feel sure there
is a tree-trunk beneath it, the very root on which
I used to sit and sketch.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>He clears away some of the moss.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> It is a tree-trunk right enough.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> I believe—I believe I cut my
name on it with a knife.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> This looks like it. ‘M—A—R—’
and there it stops. That is always where the
blade of the knife breaks.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> My ownest seat, how I have
missed you.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> Don’t you believe it, old tree-trunk.
She had forgotten all about you, and you just
came vaguely back to her mind because we
happened to be in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Yes, I suppose that is true.
You were the one who wanted to come, Simon.
I wonder why?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON</span> (<i>with his answer ready</i>). No particular
reason. I wanted to see a place you had visited
as a child; that was all. But what a trumpery
island it proves to be.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE</span> (<i>who perhaps agrees with him</i>).
How can you? Even if it is true, you needn’t
say it before them all, hurting their feelings.
Dear seat, here is one for each year I have
been away. (<i>She kisses the trunk a number
of times.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON</span> (<i>counting</i>). Eleven. Go on, give it all
the news. Tell it we don’t have a house of our
own yet.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> You see, dear seat, we live with
my daddy and mother, because Simon is so often
away at sea. You know, the loveliest thing in
the world is the navy, and the loveliest thing in
the navy is H.M.S. <i>Valiant</i>, and the loveliest
thing on H.M.S. <i>Valiant</i> is Lieutenant Simon
Sobersides, and the loveliest thing on Lieutenant
Simon Sobersides is the little tuft of hair which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
will keep standing up at the back of his
head.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<span class="allsmcap">SIMON</span>, <i>who is lolling on the moss, is so
used to her prattle that his eyes close.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>But, listen, you trees, I have a much more
wonderful secret than that. You can have three
guesses. It is this ... I—have—got—a baby!
A girl? No thank you. He is two years and
nine months, and he says such beautiful things
to me about loving me. Oh, rowan, do you
think he means them?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> I distinctly heard it say yes.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>He opens his eyes, to see her gazing
entranced across the water.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>You needn’t pretend that you can see him.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> I do. Can’t you? He is waving
his bib to us.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> That is nurse’s cap.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Then he is waving it. How
clever of him. (<i>She waves her handkerchief.</i>)
Now they are gone. Isn’t it funny to think
that from this very spot I used to wave to father?
That was a happy time.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> I should be happier here if I wasn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
so hungry. I wonder where Cameron is. I told
him after he landed us to tie up the boat at any
good place and make a fire. I suppose I had
better try to make it myself.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> How you can think of food at
such a time!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON</span> (<i>who is collecting sticks</i>). All very well,
but you will presently be eating more than your
share.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Do you know, Simon, I don’t
think daddy and mother like this island.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON</span> (<i>on his guard</i>). Help me with the fire,
you chatterbox.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>He has long ceased to credit the story he
heard four years ago, but he is ever watchful
for</i> <span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE</span>.)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> They never seem to want to
speak of it.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> Forgotten it, I suppose.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> I shall write to them from the
inn this evening. How surprised they will be
to know I am there again.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON</span> (<i>casually</i>). I wouldn’t write from there.
Wait till we cross to the mainland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Why not from there?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> Oh, no reason. But if they have a
distaste for the place, perhaps they wouldn’t
like our coming. I say, praise me, I have got
this fire alight.</p>

<p>MARY ROSE (<i>who is occasionally pertinacious</i>).
Simon, why did you want to come to my island
without me?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> Did I? Oh, I merely suggested your
remaining at the inn because I thought you
seemed tired. I wonder where Cameron can
have got to.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Here he comes. (<i>Solicitously.</i>)
Do be polite to him, dear; you know how
touchy they are.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> I am learning!</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>The boat, with</i> <span class="allsmcap">CAMERON</span>, <i>draws in. He

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON</span> (<i>in the soft voice of the Highlander</i>).
Iss it the wish of Mr. Blake that I should land?</p>

I open the basket?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> We shall tumble out the luncheon

show my wife, Cameron, how one cooks fish by
the water’s edge.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> I will do it with pleasure. (<i>He
pauses.</i>) There iss one little matter; it iss of
small importance. You may haf noticed that
I always address you as Mr. Blake. I notice
that you always address me as Cameron; I take
no offence.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Oh dear, I am sure I always
address you as Mr. Cameron.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> That iss so, ma’am. You may
haf noticed that I always address you as
‘ma’am.’ It iss my way of indicating that I
consider you a ferry genteel young matron, and
of all such I am the humble servant. (<i>He
pauses.</i>) In saying I am your humble servant
I do not imply that I am not as good as you are.
With this brief explanation, ma’am, I will now
fetch the trouts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span><span class="allsmcap">SIMON</span> (<i>taking advantage of his departure</i>). That
is one in the eye for me. But I’m hanged if I
mister him.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Simon, do be careful. If you
want to say anything to me that is dangerous,
say it in French.</p>

I would not use the word heavenly in this

What was that book you were reading, Cameron,

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> It may be Latin, but in these

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> I am ferry pleased to make
Mistress Blake’s acquaintance. Iss Mistress
Blake making a long stay in these parts?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> No, alas, we go across to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> I hope the weather will be
favourable.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Thank you (<i>passing him the sandwiches</i>).
And now, you know, you are our guest.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> I am much obliged. (<i>He examines
the sandwiches with curiosity.</i>) Butcher-meat!
This iss ferry excellent.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>He bursts into a surprising fit of laughter,
and suddenly cuts it off.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>Please to excuse my behaviour. You haf been
laughing at me all this time, but you did not
know I haf been laughing at myself also, though
keeping a remarkable control over my features.
I will now haf my laugh out, and then I will
explain. (<i>He finishes his laugh.</i>) I will now
explain. I am not the solemn prig I haf pretended
to you to be, I am really a fairly attractive
young man, but I am shy and I haf been
guarding against your taking liberties with me,
not because of myself, who am nothing, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
because of the noble profession it iss my ambition
to enter. (<i>They discover that they like him.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Do tell us what that is.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> It iss the ministry. I am a student
of Aberdeen University, and in the vacation I
am a boatman, or a ghillie, or anything you
please, to help to pay my fees.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> Well done!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> I am obliged to Mr. Blake. And
I may say, now that we know one another
socially, that there iss much in Mr. Blake which
I am trying to copy.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> Something in me worth copying!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> It iss not Mr. Blake’s learning;
he has not much learning, but I haf always
understood that the English manage without it.
What I admire in you iss your ferry nice manners
and your general deportment, in all which I haf
a great deal to learn yet, and I watch these
things in Mr. Blake and take memoranda of
them in a little note-book.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<span class="allsmcap">SIMON</span> <i>expands</i>.)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Mr. Cameron, do tell me that I
also am in the little note-book?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> You are not, ma’am, it would not
be seemly in me. But it iss written in my heart,
and also I haf said it to my father, that I will
remain a bachelor unless I can marry some lady
who iss ferry like Mistress Blake.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Simon, you never said anything
to me as pretty as that. Is your father a crofter
in the village?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> Yes, ma’am, when he iss not at
the University of Aberdeen.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> My stars, does he go there too?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> He does so. We share a ferry
small room between us.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> Father and son. Is he going into
the ministry also?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> Such iss not his purpose. When
he has taken his degree he will return and be a
crofter again.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> In that case I don’t see what he is
getting out of it.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> He iss getting the grandest thing
in the world out of it; he iss getting education.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<span class="allsmcap">SIMON</span> <i>feels that he is being gradually
rubbed out, and it is a relief to him that</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">CAMERON</span> <i>has now to attend to the trout.
The paper they are wrapped in has begun
to burn.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE</span> (<i>for the first time eating of trout as
it should be cooked</i>). Delicious! (<i>She offers a
portion to</i> <span class="allsmcap">CAMERON</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> No, I thank you. I haf lived on
trouts most of my life. This butcher-meat iss
more of an excellent novelty to me.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>He has been standing all this time.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Do sit down, Mr. Cameron.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> I am doing ferry well here, I
thank you.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> But, please.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON</span> (<i>with decision</i>). I will not sit down
on this island.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON</span> (<i>curiously</i>). Come, come, are you
superstitious, you who are going into the
ministry?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> This island has a bad name. I
haf never landed on it before.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> A bad name, Mr. Cameron? Oh,
but what a shame! When I was here long ago,
I often came to the island.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> Iss that so? It was not a chancey
thing to do.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> But it is a darling island.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> That iss the proper way to speak
of it.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> I am sure I never heard a word
against it. Have you, Simon?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON</span> (<i>brazenly</i>). Not I. I have heard that
its Gaelic name has an odd meaning—‘The
Island that Likes to be Visited,’ but there is
nothing terrifying in that.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> The name is new to me, Mr.
Cameron. I think it is sweet.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> That iss as it may be, Mistress
Blake.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> What is there against the island?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> For one thing, they are saying it
has no authority to be here. It was not always
here, so they are saying. Then one day it
was here.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> That little incident happened before
your time I should say, Mr. Cameron.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> It happened before the time of
any one now alive, Mr. Blake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> I thought so. And does the island
ever go away for a jaunt in the same way?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> There are some who say that it
does.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> But you have not seen it on the
move yourself?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> I am not always watching it, Mr.
Blake.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> Anything else against it?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> There iss the birds. Too many
birds come here. The birds like this island
more than iss seemly.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> Birds here! What could bring them
here?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> It iss said they come to listen.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> To listen to the silence? An island
that is as still as an empty church.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> I do not know; that iss what
they say.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> I think it is a lovely story about
the birds. I expect the kind things come
because this island likes to be visited.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> That iss another thing; for, mark
you, Mistress Blake, an island that had visitors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
would not need to want to be visited—and why
has it not visitors? Because they are afraid to
visit it.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Whatever are they afraid of?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> That iss what I say to them.
Whateffer are you afraid of, I say.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> But what are <i>you</i> afraid of,
Mr. Cameron?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> The same thing that they are
afraid of. There are stories, ma’am.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Do tell us; Simon, wouldn’t it
be lovely if he would tell us some misty, eerie
Highland stories?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> I don’t know; not unless they are
pretty ones.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Please, Mr. Cameron! I love
to have my blood curdled.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> There iss many stories. There
iss that one of the boy who was brought
to this island. He was no older than your
baby.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> What happened to him?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> No one knows, Mr. Blake. His
father and mother and their friends, they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
gathering rowans on the island, and when they
looked round he was gone.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> Lost?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> He could not be found. He was
never found.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Never! He had fallen into the
water?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> That iss a good thing to say, that
he had fallen into the water. That iss what I say.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> But you don’t believe it?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> I do not.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> What do the people in the
village say?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> Some say he iss on the island still.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> Mr. Cameron! Oh, Mr. Cameron!
What does your father say?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> He will be saying that they are
not here always, but that they come and go.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> They? Who are they?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON</span> (<i>uncomfortably</i>). I do not know.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> Perhaps he heard what the birds
come to listen to!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> That iss what they say. He had
heard the island calling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span><span class="allsmcap">SIMON</span> (<i>hesitating</i>). How does the island call?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> I do not know.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> Do you know any one who has heard
the call?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> I do not. No one can hear it but
those for whom it iss meant.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> But if that child heard it, the
others must have heard it also as they were
with him.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> They heard nothing. This iss how
it will be. I might be standing close to you,
Mistress Blake, as it were here, and I might
hear it, ferry loud, terrible, or in soft whispers—no
one knows—but I would haf to go, and you
will not haf heard a sound.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Simon, isn’t it creepy!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> But full of holes, I have no doubt.
How long ago is this supposed to have happened,
credulous one?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> It was before I was born.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> I thought so.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Simon, don’t make fun of my
island. Do you know any more ducky stories
about it, Mr. Cameron?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> I cannot tell them if Mr. Blake
will be saying things the island might not like
to hear.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> Not ‘chancey,’ I suppose.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Simon, promise to be good.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> All right, Cameron.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> This one iss about a young English
miss, and they say she was about ten years of
age.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Not so much younger than I was
when I came here. How long ago was it?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> I think it iss ten years ago this
summer.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Simon, it must have been the
year after I was here!</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<span class="allsmcap">SIMON</span> <i>thinks she has heard enough</i>.)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> Very likely. But, I say, we mustn’t
stay on gossiping. We must be getting back.
Did you bail out the boat?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> I did not, but I will do it now if
such iss your wish.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> The story first; I won’t go
without the story.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> Well, then, the father of this miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
he will be fond of the fishing, and he sometimes
landed the little one on the island while he fished
round it from the boat.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Just as father used to do with
me!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> I dare say lots of bold tourists come
over here.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> That iss so, if ignorance be
boldness, and sometimes——</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> Quite so. But I really think we must
be starting.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> No, dear. Please go on, Mr.
Cameron.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> One day the father pulled over
for his little one as usual. He saw her from the
boat, and it iss said she kissed her hand to him.
Then in a moment more he reached the island,
but she was gone.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Gone?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> She had heard the call of the
island, though no sound came to him.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Doesn’t it make one shiver!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> My father was one of the searchers;
for many days they searched.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> But it would not take
many minutes to search this darling little
island.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> They searched, ma’am, long after
there was no sense in searching.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> What a curdling story! Simon
dear, it might have been Mary Rose. Is there
any more?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> There iss more. It was about a
month afterwards. Her father was walking on
the shore, over there, and he saw something
moving on the island. All in a tremble, ma’am,
he came across in the boat, and it was his little
miss.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Alive?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> Yes, ma’am.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> I am glad: but it rather spoils
the mystery.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> How, Mary Rose?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Because she could tell
them what happened, stupid. Whatever
was it?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> It iss not so easy as that. She
did not know that anything had happened. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
thought she had been parted from her father
for but an hour.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE</span> <i>shivers and takes her husband’s
hand</i>.)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON</span> (<i>speaking more lightly than he is feeling</i>).
You and your bogies and wraiths, you man of
the mists.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE</span> (<i>smiling</i>). Don’t be alarmed,
Simon; I was only pretending.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> It iss not good to disbelieve the
stories when you are in these parts. I believe
them all when I am here, though I turn the cold
light of remorseless Reason on them when I am
in Aberdeen.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> Is that ‘chancey,’ my friend? An
island that has such extraordinary powers could
surely send its call to Aberdeen or farther.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON</span> (<i>troubled</i>). I had not thought of
that. That may be ferry true.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> Beware, Mr. Cameron, lest some day
when you are preaching far from here the call
plucks you out of the very pulpit and brings
you back to the island like a trout on a long
cast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> I do not like Mr. Blake’s way of
talking. I will go and bail the boat.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>He goes back to the boat, which soon drifts
out of sight.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE</span> (<i>pleasantly thrilled</i>). Suppose it
were true, Simon!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON</span> (<i>stoutly</i>). But it isn’t.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> No, of course not; but if it had
been, how awful for the girl when her father
told her that she had been away for weeks.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> Perhaps she was never told. He
may have thought it wiser not to disturb
her.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Poor girl! Yes, I suppose that
would have been best. And yet—it was taking
a risk.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> How?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Well, not knowing what had
happened before, she might come back and—and
be caught again. (<i>She draws closer to
him.</i>) Little island, I don’t think I like you
to-day.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> If she ever comes back, let us hope
it is with an able-bodied husband to protect her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE</span> (<i>comfortably</i>). Nice people, husbands.
You won’t let them catch me, will
you, Simon?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> Let ’em try. (<i>Gaily.</i>) And now to
pack up the remnants of the feast and escape
from the scene of the crime. We will never
come back again, Mary Rose, I’m too frightened!</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>She helps him to pack.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> It is a shame to be funny about
my island. You poor, lonely isle. I never knew
about your liking to be visited, and I dare say I
shall never visit you any more. The last time
of anything is always sad, don’t you think,
Simon?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON</span> (<i>briskly</i>). There must always be a last
time, dearest dear.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Yes—I suppose—for everything.
There must be a last time I shall see you, Simon.
(<i>Playing with his hair.</i>) Some day I shall flatten
this tuft for the thousandth time, and then never
do it again.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> Some day I shall look for it and it
won’t be there. That day I shall say ‘Good
riddance.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> I shall cry. (<i>She is whimsical
rather than merry and merry rather than sad.</i>)</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<span class="allsmcap">SIMON</span> <i>touches her hair with his lips</i>.)</p>
</div>

<p>Some day, Simon, you will kiss me for the last
time.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> That wasn’t the last time at any rate.
(<i>To prove it he kisses her again, sportively, little
thinking that this may be the last time. She
quivers.</i>) What is it?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> I don’t know; something seemed
to pass over me.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> You and your last times. Let me
tell you, Mistress Blake, there will be a last
time of seeing your baby. (<i>Hurriedly.</i>) I
mean only that he can’t always be infantile;
but the day after you have seen him for the
last time as a baby you will see him for
the first time as a little gentleman. Think of
that.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE</span> (<i>clapping her hands</i>). The loveliest
time of all will be when he is a man and takes
me on his knee instead of my putting him on
mine. Oh, gorgeous! (<i>With one of her sudden
changes.</i>) Don’t you think the sad thing is that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
we seldom know when the last time has come?
We could make so much more of it.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> Don’t you believe that. To know
would spoil it all.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>The packing is nearly completed.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>I suppose I ought to stamp out the fire?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Let Cameron do that. I want
you to come and sit beside me, Simon, and make
love to me.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> What a life. Let me see now, how
does one begin? Which arm is it? I believe
I have forgotten the way.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Then I shall make love to you.
(<i>Playing with his hair.</i>) Have I been a nice wife
to you, Simon? I don’t mean always and
always. There was that awful day when I
threw the butter-dish at you. I am so sorry.
But have I been a tolerably good wife on the
whole, not a wonderful one, but a wife that
would pass in a crowd?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> Look here, if you are going to butt
me with your head in that way, you must take
that pin out of your hair.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Have I been all right as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
mother, Simon? Have I been the sort of
mother a child could both love and respect?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> That is a very awkward question.
You must ask that of Harry Morland Blake.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Have I——?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> Shut up, Mary Rose. I know you:
you will be crying in a moment, and you don’t
have a handkerchief, for I wrapped it round the
trout whose head came off.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> At any rate, Simon Blake, say
you forgive me about the butter-dish.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> I am not so sure of that.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> And there were some other
things—almost worse than the butter-dish.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> I should just say there were.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Simon, how can you? There
was nothing so bad as that.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON</span> (<i>shaking his head</i>). I can smile at it
now, but at the time I was a miserable man. I
wonder I didn’t take to drink.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Poor old Simon. But how
stupid you were, dear, not to understand.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> How could an ignorant young
husband understand that it was a good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
sign when his wife threw the butter-dish at
him?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> You should have guessed.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> No doubt I was a ninny. But I had
always understood that when a young wife—that
then she took the husband aside and went
red, or white, and hid her head on his bosom,
and whispered the rest. I admit I was hoping
for that; but all I got was the butter-dish.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> I suppose different women have
different ways.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> I hope so. (<i>Severely.</i>) And that was
a dastard trick you played me afterwards.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Which? Oh, that! I just wanted
you to be out of the way till all was over.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> I don’t mean your getting me out
of the house, sending me to Plymouth. The
dastardliness was in not letting them tell me,
when I got back, that—that he had arrived.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> It was very naughty of me.
You remember, Simon, when you came in to
my room you tried to comfort me by saying it
wouldn’t be long now—and I let you maunder
on, you darling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> Gazing at me with solemn, innocent
eyes. You unutterable brat, Mary Rose!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> You should have been able to
read in my face how clever I had been. Oh,
Simon, when I said at last, ‘Dearest, what is
that funny thing in the bassinette?’ and you
went and looked, never shall I forget your face.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> I thought at first it was some baby
you had borrowed.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> I sometimes think so still. I
didn’t, did I?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> You are a droll one. Always just
when I think I know you at last I have to begin
at the beginning again.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE</span> (<i>suddenly</i>). Simon, if one of us had
to—to go—and we could choose which one——</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON</span> (<i>sighing</i>). She’s off again.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Well, but if—I wonder which
would be best. I mean for Harry, of course.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> Oh, I should have to hop it.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Dear!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> Oh, I haven’t popped off yet. Steady,
you nearly knocked over the pickles. (<i>He regards
her curiously.</i>) If I did go, I know your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
first thought would be ‘The happiness of Harry
must not be interfered with for a moment.’ You
would blot me out for ever, Mary Rose, rather
than he should lose one of his hundred laughs
a day.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>She hides her face.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>It’s true, isn’t it?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> It is true, at any rate, that if I
was the one to go, that is what I should like
you to do.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> Rather.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> But you can tie up marmalade.
Why don’t you scream with happiness? One
of us has got to scream.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> I must say good-bye to my

when I am an old lady with wrinkles, and you
won’t know your Mary Rose.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> I say, dear, do dry up. I can’t help
listening to you when I ought to be getting this
fire out.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> I won’t say another word.</p>

<p><i>Twenty-five years have passed, and the scene is again
that cosy room in the Morlands’ house, not much
changed since we last saw it. If chintzes have faded,
others as smiling have taken their place. The time
is a crisp autumn afternoon just before twilight
comes. The apple-tree, not so easy to renew as the
chintzes, has become smaller, but there are a few
gallant apples on it. The fire is burning, and round
it sit Mr. and Mrs. Morland and Mr. Amy, the
Morlands gone smaller like the apple-tree and Mr.
Amy bulky, but all three on the whole still bearing
their apples. Inwardly they have changed still less;
hear them at it as of yore.</i></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> What are you laughing over,
Fanny?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND.</span> It is this week’s <i>Punch</i>, so
very amusing.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. AMY.</span> Ah, <i>Punch</i>, it isn’t what it used to
be.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> No, indeed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND.</span> I disagree. You two try if
you can look at this picture without laughing.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>They are unable to stand the test.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> I think I can say that I enjoy
a joke as much as ever.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND.</span> You light-hearted old man!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND</span> (<i>humorously</i>). Not so old,
Fanny. Please to remember that I am two
months younger than you.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND.</span> How can I forget it when
you have been casting it up against me all our
married life?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND</span> (<i>not without curiosity</i>). Fanny
and I are seventy-three; you are a bit younger,
George, I think?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. AMY.</span> Oh yes, oh dear, yes.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> You never say precisely what
your age is.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. AMY.</span> I am in the late sixties. I am
sure I have told you that before.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> It seems to me you have been
in the sixties longer than it is usual to be in
them.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND</span> (<i>with her needles</i>). James!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> No offence, George, I was
only going to say that at seventy-three I certainly
don’t feel my age. How do you feel,
George, at—at sixty-six? (<i>More loudly, as if</i>
<span class="allsmcap">MR. AMY</span> <i>were a little deaf</i>.) Do you feel your
sixty-six years?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. AMY</span> (<i>testily</i>). I am more than sixty-six.
But I certainly don’t feel my age. It was only
last winter that I learned to skate.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> I still go out with the hounds.
You forgot to come last time, George.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. AMY.</span> If you are implying anything
against my memory, James.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND</span> (<i>peering through his glasses</i>).
What do you say?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. AMY.</span> I was saying that I have never
used glasses in my life.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> If I wear glasses occasionally
it certainly isn’t because there is anything defective
in my eyesight. But the type used by
newspapers nowadays is so vile——</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. AMY.</span> There I agree with you. Especially
Bradshaw.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND</span> (<i>not hearing him</i>). I say the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
type used by newspapers of to-day is vile.
Don’t you think so?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. AMY.</span> I have just said so. (<i>Pleasantly.</i>)
You are getting rather dull of hearing, James.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> I am? I like that, George!
Why, I have constantly to shout to you nowadays.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. AMY.</span> What annoys me is not that you
are a little deaf, you can’t help that. But from
the nature of your replies I often see that you
are pretending to have heard what I said when
you did not. That is rather vain, James.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> Vain! Now you brought
this on yourself, George. I have got something
here I might well be vain of, and I meant not to
show it to you because it will make you squirm.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND</span> <i>taps warningly</i>.)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> I didn’t mean that, George.
I am sure that you will be delighted. What do
you think of this?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. AMY</span> (<i>with a sinking</i>). Very nice. What
do you call it?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> Have you any doubt? I haven’t
the slightest. I am sure that it is an early Turner.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. AMY</span> (<i>paling</i>). Turner!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> What else can it be? Holman
suggested a Gurton or even a Dayes. Absurd!
Why, Dayes was only a glorified drawing-master.
I flatter myself I can’t make a mistake about a
Turner. There is something about a Turner
difficult to define, but unmistakable, an absolute
something. It is a charming view, too;
Kirkstall Abbey obviously.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. AMY.</span> Rivaulx, I am convinced.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> I say Kirkstall.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND</span> (<i>with her needles</i>). James!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> Well, you may be right, the
place doesn’t matter.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. AMY.</span> There is an engraving of Rivaulx
in that Copperplate Magazine we were looking
at. (<i>He turns up the page.</i>) I have got it,
Rivaulx. (<i>He brightens.</i>) Why, this is funny.
It is an engraving of that very picture. Hello,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
hello, hello. (<i>Examining it through his private

had this disappointment.</p>

chagrin I can well understand, but surely your
sense of manhood—I regret that I have out-stayed
my welcome. I bid you good afternoon.
Thank you, Mrs. Morland, for your unvarying
hospitality.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND.</span> I shall see you into your

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. AMY.</span> It is very kind of you, but I need

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> It is so long since she—how
long is it, Fanny?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND.</span> Twenty-five years, a third of

the twilight running across the fields. Draw

<p>Simon’s train must be nearly due, is it not?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> In ten minutes or so. Did
you forward his telegram?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND.</span> No, I thought he would
probably get it sooner if I kept it here.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> I dare say. (<i>He joins her on

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND.</span> What is it, dear?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> I am afraid I was rather
thoughtless about the apple-tree, Fanny. I
hurt you.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND</span> (<i>brightly</i>). Such nonsense.
Have another pipe, James.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND</span> (<i>doggedly</i>). I will not have

smoking for a week as a punishment to myself.

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND.</span> You will regret this, you

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND</span> (<i>his breast ceasing to swell</i>). Why

years ago, just as yours did.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND.</span> Mine didn’t, dear.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> In a way it did. As for me,
at the time I thought I could never raise my
head again, but there is a deal of the old Adam
in me still. I ride and shoot and laugh and
give pompous decisions on the bench and
wrangle with old George as if nothing much had
happened to me. I never think of the island
now; I dare say I could go back there and fish.
(<i>He finds that despite his outburst his hand has
strayed towards his tobacco-pouch.</i>) See what I
am doing! (<i>He casts his pouch aside as if it
were the culprit.</i>) I am a man enamoured of
myself. Why, I have actually been considering,
Fanny, whether I should have another dress
suit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND</span> (<i>picking up the pouch</i>). And
why shouldn’t you?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> At my age! Fanny, this
should be put on my tombstone: ‘In spite of
some adversity he remained a lively old blade
to the end.’</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND.</span> Perhaps that would be a
rather creditable epitaph for any man, James,
who has gone through as much as you have.
What better encouragement to the young than
to be able to tell them that happiness keeps
breaking through? (<i>She puts the pipe, which
she has been filling, in his mouth.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> If I smoke, Fanny, I shall

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND.</span> To please me.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND</span> (<i>as she holds the light</i>). I don’t
feel easy about it, not at all easy. (<i>With a happy

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND.</span> Your dress suit is shining
like a mirror.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> Isn’t it! I thought of a
jacket suit only. The V-shaped waistcoat seems
to be what they are all wearing now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND.</span> Would you have braid on
the trousers?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> I was wondering. You see— Oh,
Fanny, you are just humouring me.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND.</span> Not at all. And as for the old
Adam in you, dear Adam, there is still something
of the old Eve in me. Our trip to Switzerland
two years ago with Simon, I enjoyed every
hour of it. The little card parties here, am I not
called the noisy one; think of the girls I have
chaperoned and teased and laughed with, just
as if I had never had a girl myself.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> Your brightness hasn’t been
all pretence?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND.</span> No, indeed; I have passed
through the valley of the shadow, dear, but I
can say thankfully that I have come out again
into the sunlight. (<i>A little tremulously.</i>) I suppose
it is all to the good that as the years go by
the dead should recede farther from us.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> Some say they don’t.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND.</span> You and I know better,
James.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> Up there in the misty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
Hebrides I dare say they think of her as on the
island still. Fanny, how long is it since—since
you half thought <i>that</i> yourself?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND.</span> Ever so many years. Perhaps
not the first year. I did cling for a time——</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> The neighbours here didn’t
like it.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND.</span> She wasn’t their Mary Rose,
you see.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> And yet her first disappearance——</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND.</span> It is all unfathomable. It
is as if Mary Rose was just something beautiful
that you and I and Simon had dreamt together.
You have forgotten much, but so have I. Even
that room—(<i>she looks towards the little door</i>)—that
was hers and her child’s during all her short
married life—I often go into it now without
remembering that it was theirs.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> It is strange. It is rather
terrible. You are pretty nigh forgotten, Mary
Rose.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND.</span> That isn’t true, dear. Mary
Rose belongs to the past, and we have to live in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
the present, for a very little longer. Just a little
longer, and then we shall understand all. Even
if we could drag her back to tell us now what
these things mean I think it would be a shame.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> Yes, I suppose so. Do you
think Simon is a philosopher about it also?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND.</span> Don’t be bitter, James, to
your old wife. Simon was very fond of her.
He was a true lover.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> Was, was! Is it all ‘was’
about Mary Rose?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND.</span> It just has to be. He had
all the clever ones of the day advising, suggesting,
probing. He went back to the island every
year for a long time.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> Yes, and then he missed a
year, and that somehow ended it.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND.</span> He never married again.
Most men would.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> His work took her place.
What a jolly, hearty fellow he is.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND.</span> If you mean he isn’t heart-broken,
he isn’t. Mercifully the wound has
healed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> I am not criticising, Fanny.
I suppose any one who came back after twenty-five
years—however much they had been loved—it
might—we—should we know what to say to
them, Fanny?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND.</span> Don’t, James. (<i>She rises.</i>)
Simon is late, isn’t he?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> Very little. I heard the train
a short time ago, and he might be here—just—if
he had the luck to find a cab. But not if he
is walking across the fields.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND.</span> Listen!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> Yes, wheels. That is probably
Simon. He had got a cab.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND.</span> I do hope he won’t laugh at
me for having lit a fire in his room.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND</span> (<i>with masculine humour</i>). I
hope you put him out some bed-socks.</p>

You do like duck, don’t you? The train was

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> A few minutes only. I made a
selfish bolt for the one cab, and got it.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> We thought you might be
walking across the fields.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> No, I left the fields to the two
other people who got out of the train. One of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
them was a lady; I thought something about
her walk was familiar to me, but it was darkish,
and I didn’t make her out.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND.</span> Bertha Colinton, I expect.
She was in London to-day.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> If I had thought it was Mrs. Colinton
I would have offered her a lift. (<i>For a moment

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> Bravo, Simon.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> I dare say not. But they say—however.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND.</span> Simon, I had forgotten.
There is a telegram for you.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> Avaunt! I do trust it is not recalling
me. I had hoped for at least five clear days.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND</span> (<i>giving it to him</i>). We didn’t
open it.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> Two to one it is recalling me.</p>

You remember who he was. He is minister
there now. Hold my hand, and I’ll read it.
‘Your wife has come back. She was found
to-day on the island. I am bringing her to you.
She is quite well, but you will all have to be
very careful.’</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND.</span> Simon, can it be?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">SIMON.</span> I believe it absolutely. Cameron

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> He might be deceived himself;
he was a mere acquaintance.</p>

the boy who was with her that day. When she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>

so troubled already—not to tell her.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND</span> (<i>appealing</i>). But now that she
has seen Simon. His appearance, his grey hair—when
she saw him she would know.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON</span> (<i>unhappy</i>). I am not sure; it iss
dark out there.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> She must have known that
he would never have left her and come home.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> That secretly troubles her, but
she will not speak of it. There iss some terrible
dread lying on her heart.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> A dread?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND.</span> Harry. James, if she should
think that Harry is still a child!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> I never heard what became of the
boy.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. MORLAND.</span> He ran away to sea when he

from Australia, very few; we don’t know where
he is now.</p>

Cameron?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CAMERON.</span> Two men fishing from a boat saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
her. She was asleep by the shore at the very
spot where Mr. Blake made a fire so long ago.
There was a rowan-tree beside it. At first they
were afraid to land, but they did. They said
there was such a joy on her face as she slept
that it was a shame to waken her.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. MORLAND.</span> Joy?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY</span> (<i>rising</i>). Wait a mo.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>He looks about him, like one taking his
bearings.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>Gimme the tea. That’s better. Thank you,
missis.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY.</span> Have you seen anything?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> See here, as I sat in that chair—I
wasn’t sleeping, mind you—it’s no dream—but
things of the far past connected with this old
house—things I knew naught of—they came
crowding out of their holes and gathered round
me till I saw—I saw them all so clear that I
don’t know what to think, woman. (<i>He is a
grave man now.</i>) Never mind about that. Tell
me about this—ghost.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY.</span> It’s no concern of yours.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> Yes, it is some concern of mine.
The folk that used to live here—the Morlands——</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY.</span> That was the name. I suppose
you heard it in the village?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> I have heard it all my days. It is
one of the names I bear. I am one of the family.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY.</span> I suspicioned that.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> I suppose that is what made them
come to me as I sat here. Tell me about them.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY.</span> It is little I know. They were
dead and gone before my time, the old man and
his wife.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> It’s not them I am asking you about.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY.</span> They had a son-in-law, a sailor.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
The war made a great man of him before it
drowned him.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> I know that; he was my father.
Hard I used to think him, but I know better
now. Go on, there’s the other one.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY</span> (<i>reluctantly</i>). That was all.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> There is one more.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY.</span> If you must speak of her, she
is dead too. I never saw her in life.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> Where is she buried?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY.</span> Down by the church.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> Is there a stone?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> Does it say her age?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> Is that holy spot well taken care of?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY.</span> You can see for yourself.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> I will see for myself. And so it is
her ghost that haunts this house?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>She makes no answer. He struggles with
himself.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>There is no such thing as ghosts. And yet— Is
it true about folk having lived in this house
and left in a hurry?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY.</span> It’s true.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> Because of a ghost—a thing that
can’t be.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY.</span> When I came in your eyes were
staring; I thought you had seen her.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> Have you ever seen her yourself?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>She shivers.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>Where? In this room?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>She looks at the little door.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>In there? Has she ever been seen out of that
room?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY.</span> All over the house, in every room
and on the stairs. I tell you I’ve met her on the
stairs, and she drew back to let me pass and said
‘Good evening’ too, timid-like, and at another
time she has gone by me like a rush of wind.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> What is she like? Is she dressed in
white? They are allus dressed in white, aren’t
they?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY.</span> She looks just like you or me.
But for all that she’s as light as air. I’ve
seen—things.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> You look like it, too. But she is
harmless it seems?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY.</span> There’s some wouldn’t say
that; them that left in a hurry. If she thought
you were keeping it from her she would do you
a mischief.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> Keeping what from her?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY.</span> Whatever it is she prowls about
this cold house searching for, searching, searching.
I don’t know what it is.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY</span> (<i>grimly</i>). Maybe I could tell you. I
dare say I could even put her in the way of
finding him.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY.</span> Then I wish to God you would,
and let her rest.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> My old dear, there are worse things
than not finding what you are looking for; there
is finding them so different from what you had
hoped. (<i>He moves about.</i>) A ghost. Oh no—and
yet, and yet— See here, I am going into
that room.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY.</span> As you like; I care not.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> I’ll burst open the door.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY.</span> No need; it’s not locked; I
cheated you about that.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> But I tried it and it wouldn’t open.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>(<span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY</span> <i>is very unhappy</i>.)</p>
</div>

<p>You think she is in there?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY.</span> She may be.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY</span> (<i>taking a deep breath</i>). Give me air.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>He throws open the window and we see
that it is a night of stars.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>Leave me here now. I have a call to make.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY</span> (<i>hesitating</i>). I dunno. You think
you’re in no danger, but——</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> That is how it is to be, missis. Just
ten minutes you were out of the room, did you
say?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MRS. OTERY.</span> That was all.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> God!</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>She leaves him. After a moment’s irresolution
he sets off upon his quest carrying
the candle, which takes with it all the light

of the darkness, in the little passage and

now we see the pale ghost of</i> <span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE</span>

with him</i>.)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE</span> (<i>bowing to him timidly</i>). Have
you come to buy the house?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY</span> (<i>more startled by his own voice than by
hers</i>). Not me.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> It is a very nice house. (<i>Doubtfully.</i>)
Isn’t it?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> It was a nice house once.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE</span> (<i>pleased</i>). Wasn’t it! (<i>Suspiciously.</i>)
Did you know this house?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> When I was a young shaver.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Young? Was it you who
laughed?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> When was that?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE</span> (<i>puzzled</i>). There was once some
one who laughed in this house. Don’t you
think laughter is a very pretty sound?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY</span> (<i>out of his depths</i>). Is it? I dare say.
I never thought about it.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> You are quite old.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> I’m getting on.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE</span> (<i>confidentially</i>). Would you mind
telling me why every one is so old? I don’t
know you, do I?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> I wonder. Take a look. You might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
have seen me in the old days—playing about—outside
in the garden—or even inside.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> You—you are not Simon, are
you?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> No. (<i>Venturing.</i>) My name is Harry.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE</span> (<i>stiffening</i>). I don’t think so. I
strongly object to your saying that.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> I’m a queer sort of cove, and I
would like to hear you call me Harry.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE</span> (<i>firmly</i>). I decline. I regret, but
I absolutely decline.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> No offence.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> I think you are sorry for me.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> I am that.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> I am sorry for me, too.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY</span> (<i>desperately desirous to help her</i>). If
only there was something I— I know nothing
about ghosts—not a thing; can they sit down?
Could you——?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>He turns the chair toward her.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> That is your chair.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> What do you mean by that?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> That is where you were
sitting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> Were you in this room when I was sitting
there?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> I came in to look at you.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>A sudden thought makes him cross with
the candle to where he had left his knife.

</div>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> Where is my knife? Were you standing
looking at me with my knife in your hand?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>She is sullenly silent.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>Give me my knife.</p>

</div>

<p>What made you take it?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> I thought you were perhaps the one.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> The one?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> The one who stole him from me.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> I see. Godsake, in a sort of way I
suppose I am.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>He sits in the chair.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Give him back to me.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> I wish I could. But I’m doubting
he is gone beyond recall.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE</span> (<i>unexpectedly</i>). Who is he?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> Do you mean you have forgotten
who it is you are searching for?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> I knew once. It is such a long
time ago. I am so tired; please can I go away
and play now?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> Go away? Where? You mean
back to that—that place?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>She nods.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>What sort of a place is it? Is it good to be
there?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Lovely, lovely, lovely.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> It’s not just the island, is it, that’s
so lovely, lovely?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>She is perplexed.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>Have you forgotten the island too?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> I am sorry.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> The island, the place where you heard
the call.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> What is that?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> You have even forgotten the call!
With vision as far as I can make out, it was
as if, in a way, there were two kinds of dogs
out hunting you—the good and the bad.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE</span> (<i>who thinks he is chiding her</i>).
Please don’t be cross with me.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> I am far from cross with you. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
begin to think it was the good dogs that got
you. Are they ghosts in that place?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE</span> (<i>with surprising certainty</i>). No.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> You are sure?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Honest Injun.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> What fairly does me is, if the place
is so lovely, what made you leave it?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE</span> (<i>frightened</i>). I don’t know.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> Do you think you could have fallen
out?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> I don’t know. (<i>She thinks his
power is great.</i>) Please, I don’t want to be a
ghost any more.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> As far as I can see, if you wasn’t
a ghost there you made yourself one by coming
back. But it’s no use your expecting me to
be able to help you. (<i>She droops at this and
he holds out his arms.</i>) Come to me, ghostie; I
wish you would.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE</span> (<i>prim again</i>). Certainly not.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> If you come, I’ll try to help you.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>She goes at once and sits on his knee.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>See here, when I was sitting by the fire alone I
seemed to hear you as you once were saying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
that some day when he was a man you would
like to sit on your Harry’s knee.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE</span> (<i>vaguely quoting she knows not
whom</i>). The loveliest time of all will be when
he is a man and takes me on his knee instead
of my taking him on mine.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> Do you see who I am now?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Nice man.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> Is that all you know about me?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> There is a name I would like to call
you by, but my best course is not to worry you.
Poor soul, I wonder if there was ever a man
with a ghost on his knee before.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> I don’t know.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> Seems to me you’re feared of being
a ghost. I dare say, to a timid thing, being a
ghost is worse than seeing them.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> Is it lonely being a ghost?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> Do you know any other ghosts?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> Would you like to know other ghosts?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> I can understand that. And now
you would like to go away and play?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Please.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> In this cold house, when you should
be searching, do you sometimes play by yourself
instead?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE</span> (<i>whispering</i>). Don’t tell.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> Not me. You’re a pretty thing.
What beautiful shoes you have.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>She holds out her feet complacently.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Nice buckles.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> I like your hair.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Pretty hair.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> Do you mind the tuft that used
to stand up at the back of—of Simon’s
head?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE</span> (<i>merrily</i>). Naughty tuft.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> I have one like that.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE</span> (<i>smoothing it down</i>). Oh dear, oh
dear, what a naughty tuft.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> My name is Harry.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE</span> (<i>liking the pretty sound</i>). Harry,
Harry, Harry, Harry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> But you don’t know what Harry I am.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> And this brings us no nearer what’s
to be done with you. I would willingly stay
here though I have my clearing in Australy,
but you’re just a ghost. They say there are
ways of laying ghosts, but I am so ignorant.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE</span> (<i>imploringly</i>). Tell me.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> I wish I could; you are even more
ignorant than I am.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Tell me.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> All I know about them for certain
is that they are unhappy because they can’t
find something, and then once they’ve got the
thing they want, they go away happy and never
come back.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Oh, nice.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> The one thing clear to me is that
you have got that thing at last, but you are too
dog-tired to know or care. What you need now is
to get back to the place you say is lovely, lovely.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Yes, yes.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> It sounds as if it might be Heaven,
or near thereby.</p>

<p>Queer, you that know so much can tell nothing,
and them that know nothing can tell so much. If
there was any way of getting you to that glory
place!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Tell me.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY</span> (<i>desperate</i>). He would surely send for
you, if He wanted you.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> It’s like as if He had forgotten
you.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> It’s as if nobody wanted you,
either there or here.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Yes. (<i>She rises.</i>) Bad man.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">HARRY.</span> It’s easy to call me names, but the
thing fair beats me. There is nothing I wouldn’t
do for you, but a mere man is so helpless. How
should the likes of me know what to do with a
ghost that has lost her way on earth? I wonder
if what it means is that you broke some law, just
to come back for the sake of—of that Harry? If
it was that, it’s surely time He overlooked it.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MARY ROSE.</span> Yes.</p>

one who can hear, it is the only sound in
the world. Mary Rose, Mary Rose. As
it wraps her round, the weary little ghost
knows that her long day is done. Her face
is shining. The smallest star shoots down
as if it were her star sent for her, and with
her arms stretched forth to it trustingly she
walks out through the window into the
empyrean. The music passes with her.</i>

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
